# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: August 15, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: I contributed to open-source projects on GitHub for the first time. As a part of that, I sent in my first pull request.

**Thoughts** It felt amazing to do something that I felt was an impossible task for a beginner. Understanding the full code of an open-source project is difficult and I barely know what I'm doing, but it was definitely a step forward to getting my feet wet. After going through the fixes manually, I learned that I need to learn to set up unit tests.
