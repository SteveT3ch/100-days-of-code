# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: August 15, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

I contributed to open-source projects on GitHub for the first time. 
As a part of that, I sent in my first pull request.

**Thoughts**: 

It felt amazing to do something that I initially believed was an impossible task for a beginner. 
Understanding the full code of an open-source project is difficult and I barely know what I'm doing, but it was definitely a step forward in getting my feet wet. 
After going through the fixes manually, I learned that I need to learn to set up unit tests.

### Day 2: August 16, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

I wanted to finally have a project I can call my own. 
Fellow microbiologists in my department often have issues with italicization errors that are tough to pick out manually when drafting their manuscripts. 
The easiest way to implement that would be to develop a MS Word add-in to auto-correct according to the microbiology nomenclature style. 
I got started on Javascript with the book "Eloquent Javascript" by Marjin Haverbeke. 
Today, I was only able to initialize the add-in on Visual Studio and create a git repo.

**Thoughts**: 

Everything here feels very new. 
I have zero experience in Javascript and I have to develop it on a different machine as Linux can't run MS Office. 
It will be an interesting experience to learn Javascript while working on this project. 
With that being said, I might be jumping the gun a bit as my Python skills are still rudimentary.

### Day 3: August 17, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

After very slow progress on my add-in project, I decided to focus on the fundamentals for this weekend.
I opened up Eloquent Javascript and finished learning about JS loops syntax. 


**Thoughts**: 

The absence of an easy "Run" function of pure JavaScript code on IDEs made testing the syntax expressions incredibly tedious.
JavaScript feels very similar to Java in its basic operators and some keywords.
Coming from Python, the way JS uses 3 arguments in its for loop feels very awkward to me.
I have a newfound appreciation for Python's straight-forward English-like statements.
