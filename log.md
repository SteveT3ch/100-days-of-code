# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: August 15, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

I contributed to open-source projects on GitHub for the first time. 
As a part of that, I sent in my first pull request.

**Thoughts**: 

It felt amazing to do something that I initially believed was an impossible task for a beginner. 
Understanding the full code of an open-source project is difficult and I barely know what I'm doing, but it was definitely a step forward in getting my feet wet. 
After going through the fixes manually, I learned that I need to learn to set up unit tests.

### Day 2: August 16, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

I wanted to finally have a project I can call my own. 
Fellow microbiologists in my department often have issues with italicization errors that are tough to pick out manually when drafting their manuscripts. 
The easiest way to implement that would be to develop a MS Word add-in to auto-correct according to the microbiology nomenclature style. 
I got started on Javascript with the book "Eloquent Javascript" by Marjin Haverbeke. 
Today, I was only able to initialize the add-in on Visual Studio and create a git repo.

**Thoughts**: 

Everything here feels very new. 
I have zero experience in Javascript and I have to develop it on a different machine as Linux can't run MS Office. 
It will be an interesting experience to learn Javascript while working on this project. 
With that being said, I might be jumping the gun a bit as my Python skills are still rudimentary.

### Day 3: August 17, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

After very slow progress on my add-in project, I decided to focus on the fundamentals for this weekend.
I opened up Eloquent Javascript and finished learning about JS loops syntax. 


**Thoughts**: 

The absence of an easy "Run" function of pure JavaScript code on IDEs made testing the syntax expressions incredibly tedious.
JavaScript feels very similar to Java in its basic operators and some keywords.
Coming from Python, the way JS uses 3 arguments in its for loop feels very awkward to me.
I have a newfound appreciation for Python's straight-forward English-like statements.

### Day 4: August 18, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished the Chapter 2 exercises on Eloquent Javascript.


**Thoughts**: 

They were not too bad since I had done similar exercises using Python.
I'm getting used to the braces and the loop syntaxes.
However, I'm getting incredibly frustrated with trying to output Javascript code on the IDE.
I really need to learn how to link JavaScript output with HTML.
Maybe I'll take the freecodecamp.com Front-end course.

### Day 5: August 19, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished the Chapter 3 exercises on Eloquent Javascript. Completed the basic HTML5 section of freecodecamp.org.


**Thoughts**: 

I already have experience with functions so the exercises were easy.
I want to start making my Javascript work in a web page so I started taking the freecodecamp.org course.
The hands-on approach of teaching on freecodecamp.org makes it really easy to grasp the concept.
I'll try to finish a chunk every day.

### Day 6: August 20, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Worked on the Chapter 4 exercises on Eloquent Javascript (not yet finished).


**Thoughts**: 

The array section for this book is much more in depth than the Python resource I read for this section.
It took me a couple of hours to grasp the concepts and to start working on the exercises.
I'm a bit fatigued from work (mondays :S) so I only did a bit of the freecodecamp CSS module.

### Day 7: August 21, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished the Chapter 4 exercise "Reversing an array" on Eloquent Javascript. Completed the Basic CSS module on freecodecamp.


**Thoughts**: 

It broke my heart when I discovered that Javascript doesn't have reverse indexes on their arrays.
I initially thought it would be a piece of cake and I wrote the code like I would on Python, using a for loop to append the items with the negative index.
Then, I figured out that I could reverse the count of the for loop to make it work.

### Day 8: August 22, 2018 - Wedsday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished the Chapter 4 exercise "A list" on Eloquent Javascript. Did some of the Applied Visual Design module on freecodecamp.


**Thoughts**: 

I was stuck on this exercise for at least a couple of hours.
I was floundering around with for loops and replacing the list object with recursion using list, which was a big mistake.
Truth be told, I had to look up the answer of the arrayToList function on StackOverflow.
I didn't know that array items can be spliced and then added individually in sequential order in the current object.
In fact, I still don't understand how the data is stored and how the for loop calls each one in sequential order.
After that, I was able to eventually make the other 3 functions.
The most interesting thing I learned was that you can access nested objects by using object = object.nestLocation.
Despite feeling like a very slow learner, I learned a very important concept and feel that I got a better understanding of nested objects.

### Day 9: August 23, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

Wrote a Python script to automate book giveaways using Selenium.

**Thoughts**: 
I wrote this a while back but I accidentally deleted it when I was migrating over to Linux.
Unfortunately, I don't remember how to make most of it so it still feels completely new to me.
I need to replicate this in Javascript at some point, and make it a web app.
Ultimately, I didn't end up doing much today because I had evening plans with friends.

### Day 10: August 24, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

Short day. Worked on Applied Visual Design on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: 
The actual functions are ridiculously easy to grasp, but the actual design concepts are difficult to truly understand.
I'm just randomly putting in commands.
I try to think about what I'm doing and how it improves design, but it doesn't really resonate with me.
Some CSS tricks are insanely cool, like the crescent moon and heart shapes.

### Day 11: August 25, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished 2 short modules: Applied Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Principles.

**Thoughts**: 
Not a lot of actual coding today but covered some important concepts, particularly when it comes to catering to special needs.
The weekend should be when I'm fired up, but after some late nights this week I just needed to take it easy today.
I'm hoping to get back into it tomorrow.
