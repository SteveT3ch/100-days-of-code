# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: August 15, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

I contributed to open-source projects on GitHub for the first time. 
As a part of that, I sent in my first pull request.

**Thoughts**: 

It felt amazing to do something that I initially believed was an impossible task for a beginner. 
Understanding the full code of an open-source project is difficult and I barely know what I'm doing, but it was definitely a step forward in getting my feet wet. 
After going through the fixes manually, I learned that I need to learn to set up unit tests.

### Day 2: August 16, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

I wanted to finally have a project I can call my own. 
Fellow microbiologists in my department often have issues with italicization errors that are tough to pick out manually when drafting their manuscripts. 
The easiest way to implement that would be to develop a MS Word add-in to auto-correct according to the microbiology nomenclature style. 
I got started on Javascript with the book "Eloquent Javascript" by Marjin Haverbeke. 
Today, I was only able to initialize the add-in on Visual Studio and create a git repo.

**Thoughts**: 

Everything here feels very new. 
I have zero experience in Javascript and I have to develop it on a different machine as Linux can't run MS Office. 
It will be an interesting experience to learn Javascript while working on this project. 
With that being said, I might be jumping the gun a bit as my Python skills are still rudimentary.

MBIO Auto-correct MS Word add-in (No longer exists. Rewritten and re-uploaded as MBIOBuddy).


### Day 3: August 17, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

After very slow progress on my add-in project, I decided to focus on the fundamentals for this weekend.
I opened up Eloquent Javascript and finished learning about JS loops syntax. 

**Thoughts**: 

The absence of an easy "Run" function of pure JavaScript code on IDEs made testing the syntax expressions incredibly tedious.
JavaScript feels very similar to Java in its basic operators and some keywords.
Coming from Python, the way JS uses 3 arguments in its for loop feels very awkward to me.
I have a newfound appreciation for Python's straight-forward English-like statements.


### Day 4: August 18, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished the Chapter 2 exercises on Eloquent Javascript.

**Thoughts**: 

They were not too bad since I had done similar exercises using Python.
I'm getting used to the braces and the loop syntaxes.
However, I'm getting incredibly frustrated with trying to output Javascript code on the IDE.
I really need to learn how to link JavaScript output with HTML.
Maybe I'll take the freecodecamp.com Front-end course.


### Day 5: August 19, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished the Chapter 3 exercises on Eloquent Javascript. Completed the basic HTML5 section of freecodecamp.org.

**Thoughts**: 

I already have experience with functions so the exercises were easy.
I want to start making my Javascript work in a web page so I started taking the freecodecamp.org course.
The hands-on approach of teaching on freecodecamp.org makes it really easy to grasp the concept.
I'll try to finish a chunk every day.


### Day 6: August 20, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Worked on the Chapter 4 exercises on Eloquent Javascript (not yet finished).

**Thoughts**: 

The array section for this book is much more in depth than the Python resource I read for this section.
It took me a couple of hours to grasp the concepts and to start working on the exercises.
I'm a bit fatigued from work (mondays :S) so I only did a bit of the freecodecamp CSS module.


### Day 7: August 21, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished the Chapter 4 exercise "Reversing an array" on Eloquent Javascript. Completed the Basic CSS module on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: 

It broke my heart when I discovered that Javascript doesn't have reverse indexes on their arrays.
I initially thought it would be a piece of cake and I wrote the code like I would on Python, using a for loop to append the items with the negative index.
Then, I figured out that I could reverse the count of the for loop to make it work.


### Day 8: August 22, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished the Chapter 4 exercise "A list" on Eloquent Javascript. Did some of the Applied Visual Design module on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: 

I was stuck on this exercise for at least a couple of hours.
I was floundering around with for loops and replacing the list object with recursion using list, which was a big mistake.
Truth be told, I had to look up the answer of the arrayToList function on StackOverflow.
I didn't know that array items can be spliced and then added individually in sequential order in the current object.
In fact, I still don't understand how the data is stored and how the for loop calls each one in sequential order.
After that, I was able to eventually make the other 3 functions.
The most interesting thing I learned was that you can access nested objects by using object = object.nestLocation.
Despite feeling like a very slow learner, I learned a very important concept and feel that I got a better understanding of nested objects.


### Day 9: August 23, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

Wrote a Python script to automate book giveaways using Selenium.

**Thoughts**: 

I wrote this a while back but I accidentally deleted it when I was migrating over to Linux.
Unfortunately, I don't remember how to make most of it so it still feels completely new to me.
I need to replicate this in Javascript at some point, and make it a web app.
Ultimately, I didn't end up doing much today because I had evening plans with friends.


### Day 10: August 24, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

Short day. Worked on Applied Visual Design on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: 

The actual functions are ridiculously easy to grasp, but the actual design concepts are difficult to truly understand.
I'm just randomly putting in commands.
I try to think about what I'm doing and how it improves design, but it doesn't really resonate with me.
Some CSS tricks are insanely cool, like the crescent moon and heart shapes.


### Day 11: August 25, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished 2 short modules: Applied Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Principles.

**Thoughts**: 

Not a lot of actual coding today but covered some important concepts, particularly when it comes to catering to special needs.
The weekend should be when I'm fired up, but after some late nights this week I just needed to take it easy today.
I'm hoping to get back into it tomorrow.


### Skipped August 26, 2018 - Sunday (1/5)


### Missed Aug 27 - Aug 30 Due to being hospitalized on Monday evening.

I'm thankful to whichever deity or forces are real for letting me survive for another day and keep on learning what I love.


### Day 12: August 31, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished CSS flexbox on freeCodeCamp. Worked on recursion exercise for deep object comparisons.

**Thoughts**: 

Almost died due to bleeding out in the ER. Hospitalized until Thursday evening.
Due to my current condition, I can only spend a few hours coding despite having all the time in the world.
This near-miss gave me a new resolve to truly immerse myself in tech concepts and learn every concept inside-out.
Anyways, I'm starting out light but I will be picking up the pace so I can finally get to working on personal web app projects.
Recursion is a tricky concept to grasp, especially when working with loops that access different levels of nested objects... not to mention that comparison involves accessing two objects.
It hasn't clicked yet for me but I will keep bashing my head against it until it works.
Also, I almost finished my Goodreads auto-giveaway script in Python on Monday. I might just remake it in Javascript and add a GUI instead, but I'll look over that at another time.
Goodreads gutted their giveaway program so it doesn't give me a lot of motivation to work on it.


### Day 13: September 1, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished CSS grid on freeCodeCamp. Completed my first HTML/CSS project (tribute page).

**Thoughts**: 

The HTML portion was a breeze but I couldn't remember any CSS image manipulation tricks.
I had to shamefully pull a solution online to center my image element relative to parent.
CSS is tricky, so I will need to put in the time so I can at least be half-competent.
I can't wait until I get to the JavaScript portion.
Markup languages are a bit boring.

### Day 14: September 2, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 

Completed my second and third HTML/CSS project.

**Thoughts**: 

I finished making the survey form.
CSS is extremely tricky to get working properly. The way I'm doing it now has me using a lot of shortcuts and half-assed design to get through it.
I think that learning how to use the HTML/CSS suite is a valuable lesson, but I definitely don't want to be doing this for a living.
That being said, the tricks used to make a static top navigation bar was pretty cool.
Coding algorithms and working out problems in programming languages are more up my alley than placements and aesthetic design.

### Day 15: September 3, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Completed all of the HTML/CSS projects.

**Thoughts**: 

After getting some practice with it, I'm a lot better at using CSS.
I'm still terrible at it but my web pages don't look like they're from the 1990s anymore.
From now on, I'm going to be inspecting every website to steal cool design tricks. Until recently, I didn't know CSS was also allowed to be inspected.
It's really neat seeing what tricks developers use to make the design of the site come out that way.
Whew, but I'm finally done with mark-up. I'm going to continue practicing but now it's time to hit the main course.

### Day 16: September 4, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Completed 75% of the Basic Javascript module on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: 

I breezed through most of the content as I am quite familiar with the basic syntax of JS.
However, I find myself getting quite bored with this style of teaching. I don't feel like I'm retaining much information from these.
I need to look for some projects to build in addition to working through the exercises.
The exercises alone won't get me anywhere.


### Day 17: September 5, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Completed 90% of the Basic Javascript module on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: 

Some of these challenges took a while for me to finish.
It wasn't that they were intellectually challenging, but some typos set me back for longer than they should.
I need more of a keen eye.


### Day 18: September 6, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished Chapter 1 of Starting out with Java: From Control Structures through Objects.

**Thoughts**: 

I was tired from a long work day, combined with my first therapy session for social anxiety followed by a social outing.
I couldn't stare at a computer, so I took out my brother's year-old computer science textbooks to study CS fundamentals.
Java is the most popular software dev language and has very rigid syntaxes and OOP concepts so I wanted to learn some of it.
I like JS but I felt like something different.
The amount of fundamental CS concepts are something I never realized I lacked until I read the first chapter.
The book was a blast to read and learn from. If I can stomach reading formal university textbooks, I should just do that instead of being drip-fed content like in freeCodeCamp.
I still want to finish freeCodeCamp though.


### Day 19: September 7, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished the Basic Javascript module on freeCodeCamp.
Mapped out my plans for my first big project, an academic manuscript formatting assistant called MBIOBuddy.
Organized a SCRUM work batch on a Trello board.
Wrote code for wildcard search on MS Word.

**Thoughts**: 

I finally finished that darned Basic Javascript module.
Although I appreciate everything that freeCodeCamp stands for, it is difficult to retain information from such basic challenges.
Some exercises are intellectually stimulating, but others are basically copy/paste that barely hammers anything in.
The vast majority of my work tonight has been setting the foundation for my first full-on project, which is a manuscript formatting assistant add-in for MS Word.
Details about this project are in the git repo readme.
The most fascinating thing I learned today is the wildcard search feature on MS Word.
I never knew there was such a robust feature for searching a user-defined criteria, rather than a specific string.
The work ahead of me will be daunting given my inexperience, but I'm really excited to make it work.

**Link(s) to work**

MBIO Auto-correct MS Word add-in (No longer exists. Rewritten and re-uploaded as MBIOBuddy).


### Day 20: September 8, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished Chapter 2 of Starting out with Java: From Control Structures through Objects.

**Thoughts**: 

I had a bit of a rest day, so I hit the books and got through a chapter of the Java textbook and learned its syntaxes.
After getting the hang of Java's programming style, I have come to prefer it. It has also been a fantastic too for me to learn data types and OOP.


### Skipped September 9, 2018 - Sunday (2/5)
Being lazy playing video games.


### Day 21: September 10, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished Chapter 2 Algorithm workbench questions in Starting out with Java: From Control Structures through Objects.
Wrote a script in Java calculating stock solution concentrations and volumes.

**Thoughts**: 

Java syntaxes are a lot different than JavaScript.
I naively believed that because they both have curly braces and write integer for loop arguments the same way, they would have the same keywords and the same way to deal with problems.
In Java, string equality as a condition for "for" loops can't be done using the "==" operators. It must be done using variable.equals(comparisonString); .
I will work on refining this app as I learn more Java.

### Day 22: September 11, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Completed Chapter 3 in Starting out with Java: From Control Structures through Objects.
Added printf() decimal formatting to the stock solution calculator.
Started working on a Caesar cipher encryptor in HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: 

Java is really interesting to learn. It's a lot easier to absorb information using the textbook compared to online tutorials.
I'm finally getting over my procrastination to finally link JS to HTML. 
I'm participating in a monthly programming challenge on Habitica to construct an encryptor for Caesar cipher.
Unlike others who went for the unicode approach, I used index manipulation on arrays. I think my way is very resource intensive and inefficient.
I will refactor my code depending on the performance and feedback.

### Day 23: September 12, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Went to my first devClub meeting and networked with other developers.
Did some Java exercises.

**Thoughts**: 

Getting VisualStudioCode to recognize my OpenJDK PATH is killing me inside. It keeps saying JAVA_HOME environment variable points to a missing folder when it doesn't.
Got some practice with swing.JOptionPane.


### Day 24: September 13, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished Chapter 4 of Starting out with Java.

**Thoughts**: 

Learned how to create files and append information to it. I created my first log from code.
VisualStudioCode IDE had a lot of issues with Java and displaying input, but I ended up getting it all ironed out.
To display input in VisualStudioCode, one must access launch.json and edit "console" value from "internalConsole" to "externalTerminal" or "integratedTerminal".
Java has been extremely rewarding to learn. I wish there was more time in the day so I can get better at it.


### Day 25: September 14, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

Did more practice exercises at the end of Chapter 4 of Java to familiarize myself with writing simple Java classes and using PrintWriter to create logs.

**Thoughts**: 

Had somewhat of an unproductive rest day. I only tackled a couple more code challenges at the end of Chapter 4.


### Day 26: September 15, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished up the Chapter 4 challenges.
Finished Chapter 5 of the Java textbook.

**Thoughts**: 

Being able to edit and parse large paragraphs felt rewarding.
I feel very comfortable with the swing.JOptionPane GUI now.

Note: The slot machine simulation has some bugs that need to be worked out in the future to work properly. I can't figure out how to check if all 3 slots are matching.


### Day 27: September 16, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 

Started edX Harvard's CS50 course as a part of OSSU curriculum. Finished Week 0 material.
Worked on the Caesar Cipher programming challenge on JS.

**Thoughts**: 

I'm terrible at JS. I spent a lot of time just getting a basic form of the function working, but linking the input and output HTML is more challenging than I anticipated.
A part of me wants to scrap this and work on it in Java as I am spending a lot of my time learning it, but I know JS is extremely useful and in high demand.
I'm keep getting TypeErrors telling me that str.charCodeAt() is not a recognized function.
I will keep trying tomorrow. I'm bound to get it at some point, right?

### Day 28: September 17, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Worked on the Caesar Cipher programming challenge on JS. Got the output to display in HTML.

**Thoughts**: 

I finally got the TypeError sorted out. It turns out that any HTML number needs to be parseInt()'d before it can be used as a number literal.
I also learned that you can't directly make the HTML element's value a variable and expect it to display the value in HTML. 
Unfortunately, I broke my code again adding too many functions. Any output turns into a string of 01234567 in the length of the original string. This error's gotta be something interesting.

### Day 29: September 18, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished the Caesar Cipher programming challenge on JS. it is now fully functional with an encrypt, decrypt methods for up to 25 shifts (left or right).

**Thoughts**: 

I solved yesterday's problem after staring at my code for hours. The char variable was meant to represent a character in a text, but because it was simply an accumulator in a for loop, it was a number representing the index.
So I accidentally used that as an argument for the test-case functions, which obviously returned it as false as char does not yield a unicode number that falls within the alphabet letters range.
Coupled with that mistake, I also used char.codeCharAt(0), which returns the unicode of the number rather than the actual character of the text. It should have been text.codeCharAt(char);

### Day 30: September 19, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Read half of Chapter 6 of the Java textbook.

**Thoughts**: 

I came back late after the developers' club meeting and I felt mentally drained after the long day.
To make sure I don't have a zero day while making a compromised with my exhausted mental state, I decided to learn more about Java classes and UML class diagrams before I started dozing off.
Tomorrow will most likely also be an unproductive day due to a school event tomorrow evening but after that, I will get back on track.


### Day 31: September 20, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

Figuring out how to use the MS Office JS API and figuring out how to make an Office add-in.

**Thoughts**: 

After getting a boost of confidence from the Caesar Cipher challenge, I felt motivated to have a go at the MBIOBuddy add-in.
Unfortunately, I can't get it to work at all. I'm clueless about how to get any function to work properly without crashing due to critical syntax error.
Something else I need to figure out is how to cycle through search for wildcards.
I've spent 90% of tonight reading API documentation and watching MS Word add-in tutorials by Microsoft and its affiliates.
This is hard. I have a burning desire to build something meaningful but my knowledge is just so lacking.


### Day 32: September 21, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

Watched 1/3 of CS50 Week 1 lecture.

**Thoughts**: 

I had a long day at work with a workshop, so I was feeling mentally drained.
My mind was constantly nagging me to skip today, and I almost did, but I ended up making a compromise by watching part of a CS50 lecture at 1AM.
Learned about C syntaxes (which is very similar to Java).
This weekend will be filled with a lot of coding. My goal this weekend is to figure out how to use the Word API for my project.


### Day 33: September 22, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished Week 1 of CS50.
Implemented the gene italicization feature of MBIOBuddy.

**Thoughts**: 

CS50 was an absolute pleasure to watch and do. The CS50 IDE is a work of beauty and the lectures are engaging.
C feels not too bad (reminds me a lot of Java), but I am a little concerned that I'm not experiencing the notorious frustration of compiling C.
I spent all night reading Office add-in documentation to finally figure out how it works.
After weeks of no progress in this project, I finally made some headway and finished the main feature of the app.

### Day 34: September 23, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished Week 1 cont. of CS50.
Implemented the v0.1 of MBIOBuddy.

**Thoughts**: 

I finally got the MBIOBuddy app in decent shape. Learning the Office JS API was a huge learning curve, especially with zero exposure to JS frameworks.
My design skills are trash. I don't think UX design is anywhere in my future, but I need to get better.
Regardless, I feel really proud to finally get something at last. I just need to polish it and try to publish it in the store.
Some features are a bit of a distance away, but it's not crucial compared to the core features.

### Day 35: September 24, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Learned some basic Node.js for my next project.

**Thoughts**: 

I want to learn how to make a Twitter bot (and more projects in the future) using Node.js as it is a very popular framework.
However, I don't think I was getting much out of it by copy/pasting the Node.js statements since I didn't understand how Node works.
So I went to freeCodeCamp to learn the basics of Node. I think I also need to learn JSON.


### Day 36: September 25, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Debugged my Caesar Cipher decryption method.
Did some basic HackerRank problems.
Finished an exercise from the Java textbook.
Wrote a letter counter for Habitica's mini challenge in Java.

**Thoughts**: 

I had an easy day today. As I have more of an interest in algorithms and problem solving, I now realize that I need to be putting more focus on learning this facet of CS rather than making technologically primitive apps in HTML/CSS/JS.
Unfortunately, I didn't have that much time to code so I did the things I had on the back of my mind and got familiarized with the HackerRank platform. Thanks to someone's feedback, I also found a bug in my Caesar cipher and dealt with it.
I need to graduate from beginner-level algorithms and methods.

### Day 37: September 26, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Studied search and sort algorithms.
Networked with CS students at the dev club mixer.

**Thoughts**: 

I wasn't able to sit down on the computer until 11:30PM toninght. However, I was able to network with a lot of bright minds who may be a wonderful ally out in the field later in our careers.
When I had time, I was reading about linear and binary search algorithms, bubble sort algorithms, hashing, and the Big-O notation. They are technically inefficient but it was amazing reading about the different ways to perform a "search" function that users take for granted.
Finding out how hash tables work and how hashing is done based on object value was revolutionary. I finally understand why they are more efficient than searching from an array; because they essentially search a bucket they know where the object will be and "search" an array of 1 element.
Algorithms are incredibly fascinating and I look forward to learning more of them in the future.


### Day 38: September 27, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

Watched CS50 Week 2 lecture.
Did a couple of HackerRank questions.

**Thoughts**: 

I came home late due to TA'ing and I only had disjointed spare time, so I opted for some things that didn't require me to sit down and get into a creative deep work.
I have so many things I want to learn and accomplish this weekend, I can hardly contain my excitement.
Grad school is sucking my soul dry, and it's not even my research doing that. If there was any way I can dedicate more time to coding during the week.
At least thanks to the #100DaysOfCode, I can force myself to always do SOMETHING every day.


### Day 39: September 28, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

Did some exercises from Chapter 5 of Getting Started with Java. Focused on getting experience with JOptionsPane.showConfirmDialog() and NumberFormat.
Did a couple of HackerRank questions.

**Thoughts**: 

I did some exercises that helped me become a little more familiar with Java. However, my progress is slow and I get stuck on rudimentary things I should have no trouble with.
I declared a NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance() method as ``` NumberFormat curF = new curF NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(); ``` but the compiler kept returning "cannot find symbol getCurrencyInstance()".
My Java needs some serious whipping in shape if I'm struggling with referencing methods in variables.


### Day 40: September 29, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished Week 2 of CS50.
Contributed to my first JS Open-source project on GitHub.
Did a couple of HackerRank questions.

**Thoughts**: 

Writing music using C was really neat but writing individual notes was a massive pain. My music theory was also getting fairly weak.
I was having trouble with double -> integer conversion rounding down values, but I was able to solve it by adding 0.5 to each answer before converting.
Today is also the first day I contributed to an open-source project in JS. I fixed a bug on imglab.
Reading the codebase taught me a lot about jQuery and gave me inspiration for my own MBIOBuddy project.

### Day 41: September 30, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 

Refactored code for imglab open-source project.
Did a couple of HackerRank questions.

**Thoughts**: 

I am tasked with removing code that is only being used in the legacy version of imglab.
I was easily able to remove files that are only being referenced by old.html but the code in files that are being used by both is tougher to sniff out.
Whether or not I'm able to do a good job is a mystery, but I'll do it for the experience either way.
My coding time today was a bit shorter so I couldn't finish it or get to implementing custom words for MBIOBuddy, but I think I'll be able to tomorrow.

### Day 42: October 1, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Merged PRs for 3 issues for Hacktoberfest.
Learned about unit testing using mocha.

**Thoughts**: 

I skipped school because I didn't feel like waking up early and instead of doing my grad student work, I just coded all day.
Hacktoberfest started today, so I was extremely eager to start coding and get my T-shirt.
ImgLab still had some issues and I was able to find a very easy refactor issue while browsing through issues, so I went ahead and fixed them.
While most feature implementation is out of reach for my current skill level, I learned an incredibly amount from contributing.
The highlight lesson has to be not using the master branch for doing work. Always create another branch, then merge into master.
Master should always only have stable code that never gets changed.

### Day 43: October 2, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished Hacktoberfest.

**Thoughts**: 

Today was a bit of a bummer compared to yesterday. I really felt the limit of my coding skills because I couldn't even come close to cracking a lot of the issues.
So I just worked on simple documentations to meet my 5 PR quota for hacktoberfest. With this out of the way, I will get back into the rhythm of learning and advancing my skills.
I will probably wait until I'm done MBIOBuddy and next month to really tackle some significant coding issues on open source.
Having an extrinsic reward like this has made me lose my momentum and I wasn't really myself for the past couple of days. All this for a single T-shirt.

### Day 44: October 3, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Helped with documenting Typescript.
Watched week 3 CS50 lecture.

**Thoughts**: 

Documentation took a longer time than I anticipated. However, I learned some neat tricks about markdown, such as being able to use it for web pages and adding anchor tags by using `[]()`.
My coding progress has been slow this week so I need to pick it up once I'm done with these issues I volunteered myself for.

### Day 45: October 4, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

Freed myself of the documenting task.

**Thoughts**: 

I came home late today (past 10PM) and then finished that documentation task for Typescript.
I can now start coding starting tomorrow. My momentum has really taken a hit this past week.

### Skipped October 5, 2018 - Friday (3/5)

### Day 46: October 6, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished Chapter 5 questions in the Java textbook.
Did a couple of HackerRank questions.

**Thoughts**: 

I was getting myself refreshed with Java.
To make sure I run into any issues and get the fundamentals down right, I went through a dozen coding problems based on creating methods.
They're not too difficult but I learn new things about strongly-typed languages like Java every time I go through them.
For example, I learned today that Java arrays are immutable and cannot change in length, so any kind of append function is simply copying the array and making a new one, making it inefficient.
The Python list-like arrays are called ArrayList, and they have their own set of keywords.
I need to pick up the pace again in CS50, Java, and JavaScript.
MBIOBuddy is aso just sitting there, collecting dust. I need to complete it and publish it whenever I can.

### Day 47: October 7, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 

Wrote a colour guessing game and rock paper scissors simulator in Java.

**Thoughts**: 

I didn't do as much work asa I wanted to today since I wanted to finish Life is Strange: Before the Storm.
I planned out at least 4 hours of coding tomorrow to compensate.

### Day 48: October 8, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished Chapter 6 in the Java textbook.
Finished half of the coding challenges in Chapter 6.

**Thoughts**: 

I learned all about Object-Oriented Programming today. Before, it made zero sense to me but going through a detailed explanation in a textbook really helped in understanding the concept in detail.
After learning the concepts and looking at examples, I hit the drills and wrote a 21 game.
It gave me inspiration for a text-based adventure game. When I learn databases and package java files into an exe, I will develop it and demo it around.

### Day 49: October 9, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Watched the CS50 week 3 lecture.

**Thoughts**: 

I felt tired and lazy after the first day back post-long weekend. I was one step away from skipping, but I made the compromise to sit through and passively take in a CS lecture.
I will not let myself slip like this tomorrow. My progress has been slowed too much as it is.

### Day 50: October 10, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished Chapter 6 coding challenges in the Java textbook.

**Thoughts**: 

I finished up most of the self-assigned coding challenges at the end of Chapter 6. It's been a long way to Day 50, and I would have never imagined how far I would come within 2 months.
100 Days of Code is superb and really helped my lazy ass get consistently coding to make meaningful progress.
Today, basic OOP concepts, the next 50 days, master fundamental Java and JS.
Let's go!

### Day 51: October 11, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished Chapter 7 in the Java textbook.

**Thoughts**: 

Covered arrays, arrayList class, binary search, and selection sort.
It was harder to pay attention to the textbook today.

### Day 52: October 12, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

Worked on Chapter 7 coding challenges in the Java textbook.

**Thoughts**: 

These challenges involve the use of arrays in multi-file programs.
Although these aren't all that complex, I am getting more of the Java syntax muscle memory down.

### Day 53: October 13, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Worked on Chapter 7 coding challenges in the Java textbook.
Troubleshot local installation of Habitica.

**Thoughts**: 

Note: Apparently I checked in on Twitter but forgot to write an entry.
These challenges are taking a bit longer than the other chapters I've done.
It means that I need to work more on array operations.
Also, installing nodejs/mongodb projects are tougher than I anticipated. It is extremely strict about the version of the components (mongodb, nodejs, npm).
I finally got it working though. Time to contribute!

### Day 54: October 14, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 

Fixed an issue in the Habitica project.
Read up on mocha unit tests.
Updated documentation for imglab.

**Thoughts**: 

Now that I've got the local installation down, I went to go fix the issue I volunteered for.
Since the maintainers were kind enough to give away the solution (this is a good-first-issue), I was able to fix it right away.
The coolest thing was testing it in my local environment though. Creating accounts, granting subscriptions using mongodb commands, and watching my code come to life was phenomenal.
Now I need to create a unit test. Ugh, I don't know what any of these syntaxes do. This is an entirely new language that are vastly different than any other programming language.

### Day 55: October 15, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Watched CS50 Lecture.

**Thoughts**: 

Not much progress today. I allocated a separate time for coding and for CS50 so that I can make progress in both fronts now. I've neglected my CS50 too much and I need to get it done before the end of the year.

### Day 56: October 16, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Read 3 sections of Chapter 8 of the Java textbook.
Did a coding challenge using multi-dimensional arrays.

**Thoughts**: 

There are some cool things I learned with static fields and methods, as well as toString().
I realize that I spent way too much time overlearning with repetitive coding challenges.
I would be better served to go a bit deeper in and spend more time on the more challenging coding challenges rather than doing hundreds of rudimentary ones.

### Day 57: October 17, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Read Chapter 8 of the Java textbook.

**Thoughts**: 

The book taught me to consider potential security flaws when writing code. For example, calling the value of a field will reveal the memory address of the instance field, which can be accessed by code outside of the aggregator object. Making deep copies (or new copies using the value as a parameter) will prevent unwanted access to private fields.
It also covered enumerated datatypes. It is really cool how I can set instances of a class as a datatype, but I still don't fully grasp the purpose and practice application of them.
Finally, it went through the ```this``` keyword. I came across it quite a bit in Javascript code but this is the first time I've seen it in Java. I learned today that it can help avoid shadowing of parameters by instance fields.

### Skipped October 18, 2018 - Thursday (4/5)

### Day 58: October 19, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

Read Chapter 9 of the Java textbook.
Did a coding challenge to reinforce OOP concepts and practices.

**Thoughts**: 

I learned about wrapper classes today. All of the examples I was taught were from the Java API, like StringBuilder, StringTokenizer, String, Character, and etc.
This chaper also covered formatting text, but I was already familiar with them.
Today, I learned that CSV meant comma-separated values and that they can be used by tokenizing the values from the comma delimiters.
Learning to parse an Excel spreadsheet with CSV files blew my mind. So many possibilities. *drools*

### Day 59: October 20, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Read Chapter 10 of the Java textbook.

**Thoughts**: 

This chapter taught me about inheritances. I came across ```extends Class``` a few times on GitHub, but I didn't have a clue as to what it meant.
Inheritance sounds useful, but it seems like keeping track of its members as the hierarchy gets deeper and deeper will become increasingly difficult.
I also learned about abstract classes and methods. Basically like a template class (at least that's how a beginner like me understands it).

### Day 60: October 21, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 

Wrote a script that converts numbers into English, like how it's written on cheques.
Learned about interfaces.

**Thoughts**: 

I did a programming challenge that involved formatting input data into a bank cheque.
Converting the date to the xx/xx/xxxx format was simple enough, but converting the cash value to English was more work than I anticipated.
It gave me a lot of frustration but I finally got it to work after spending hours on it.

### Day 61: October 22, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Worked on a coding challenge. Still a work in progress.

**Thoughts**: 

I took Habitica's October monthly coding challenge to write an algorithm that determines the missing movements in a sequence of movements to get from the top left of a 5x5 grid to the bottom right without moving into the same spot more than once.
After working on it for a couple of hours, I arrived at an algorithm that basically determines the shortest path to the route in addition to the given movements, but I couldn't find what I was originally trying to do.
It's clear that I'm still inept at whiteboarding and solving problems. I need to approach it with a fresh mind tomorrow.

### Day 62: October 23, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Worked on the same coding challenge.
Learned how to interpret recursive methods.

**Thoughts**: 

This is the second day working at it. It frustrates me to no end that I still don't have it down yet. I got help from my brother who took CS and worked through a recursive way to go about doing it, but there are still some things inadequate about my solution.
I really need to reinforce my algorithm problem-solving skills. I feel so useless as I am now. It makes all that cookbook-style coding I've been doing feel meaningless.

### Day 63: October 24, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Read Think Like A Programmer.

**Thoughts**: 

I was out for quite a bit and had other things to finish up, so I read Think Like A Programmer while on the go. It barely counts as work but I didn't want to skip a day completely.

### Skipped October 25, 2018 - Thursday (5/5)

### Day 64: October 26, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished Week 3 Lecture of CS50.

**Thoughts**: 

I needed to refresh my mind and ease back into programming for the weekend sprint, so I resumed my CS50 progress.
As I am venturing forth deeper into programming, I am realizing that I am missing some CS fundamentals.
CS50 has been an excellent resource in bridging that gap and helping me realize why some "tricks" are the way they are.
I aim to finish 2 weeks worth of CS50 this weekend and finish up that algorithm question that's been the bane of my existence this week.

### Day 65: October 27, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Learned about hexadecimals, bitmaps (.bmp), structs in C, exact-width integers.

**Thoughts**: 

Did a CS50 assignment to decode a hidden message in a picture with a lot of noise to find out "whodunit".
It started me off with reading a premade copy.c file to understand how file reading and writing bitmap files works in C.
C is really rewarding to learn as it is teaching me data structures on a deeper level than high-level programming language courses and books.
This assignment was very hands-off so it took a while to grasp and finish, but it was very satisfying when it worked.
