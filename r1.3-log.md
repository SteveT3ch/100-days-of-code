# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 7, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Restarted 100 Days of Code. Created a skeleton GUI for my Stock Solution calculator.

**Thoughts**: 

It's been a while since I've coded. Time to get back into it. To refresh my memory, I went back to one of my old projects and made a GUI for it. I am planning on reworking the core program to fit the GUI.

### Day 2: January 9, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Added calculate functionality to my Stock Solution Calculator.

**Thoughts**: 

I managed to add a calculate functionality to my calculator GUI. I still need to add the reset functionality. It feels very satisfying to see it work without encountering errors.
