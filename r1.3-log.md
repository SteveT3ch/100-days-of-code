# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 7, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Restarted 100 Days of Code. Created a skeleton GUI for my Stock Solution calculator.

**Thoughts**: 

It's been a while since I've coded. Time to get back into it. To refresh my memory, I went back to one of my old projects and made a GUI for it. I am planning on reworking the core program to fit the GUI.

### Day 2: January 9, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Added calculate functionality to my Stock Solution Calculator.

**Thoughts**: 

I managed to add a calculate functionality to my calculator GUI. I still need to add the reset functionality. It feels very satisfying to see it work without encountering errors.

### Day 3: January 10, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

Added reset functionality and a minimum significant digit solver to my Stock Solution Calculator.

**Thoughts**: 

I am almost done this small project. I'm just wrapping it up with a neat way of dealing with answer formatting. I gotta find out how to make a standalone binary file out of this.

### Day 4: January 11, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

Added significant digit rounding capability to my Stock Solution Calculator.

**Thoughts**: 

Whew, rounding to an arbitrary number of significant digits was difficult than I initially anticipated. Aside from the lack of an executable and the bug with the number being changed (adding .0 in the String), this is almost a done deal.
I was asked to create a script for handling growth curve data in the lab so I'm hoping to brush up and learn a lot about R this weekend.

### Day 5: January 15, 2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Fixed my Goodreads Giveaway auto-entry script.

**Thoughts**: 

Once again, I've proven that my self-discipline needs work.
I need to relearn some Python syntaxes in order to write the script I've been tasked with for work. 
To start, I decided to fix up and finish up an incomplete automation script I was writing months ago.
Python is much more friendly to work with and relearn compared to other languages.
While some may argue that it feels too much like pseudocode, it lets me focus on my thought process and convey it to the code rather than trying to get around syntactical restrictions of the language.

### Day 6: January 17, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

Worked on growth curve Excel spreadsheet automation script

**Thoughts**: 

I took up openpyxl to automate the analysis of growth curve output data. It was much more challenging than initially anticipated because of the sheer amount of input required and the huge amount of variability with respect to samples.
I will most likely have to create a GUI that resembles a 96-well plate to ease the process of inputting the parameters. Otherwise, I can't see how this would be any more convenient than doing everything manually.

### Day 7: January 19, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Watched tutorial videos on making Python GUI (Tkinter)

**Thoughts**: 

I slept at 4AM so my entire day was shortened substantially. After doing what I had to do for the day, I ended up only having a small amount of time left to code. So, I decided to check off one of my to-do's and learn how to make GUIs on Python.
I chose Tkinter because it is relatively simple and requires very little dependencies. It almost feels like Java Swing, after learning a bit about it.
I'm gonna have to think hard to make it look like a 96 well plate.
