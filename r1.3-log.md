# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 7, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Restarted 100 Days of Code. Created a skeleton GUI for my Stock Solution calculator.

**Thoughts**: 

It's been a while since I've coded. Time to get back into it. To refresh my memory, I went back to one of my old projects and made a GUI for it. I am planning on reworking the core program to fit the GUI.

### Day 2: January 9, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Added calculate functionality to my Stock Solution Calculator.

**Thoughts**: 

I managed to add a calculate functionality to my calculator GUI. I still need to add the reset functionality. It feels very satisfying to see it work without encountering errors.

### Day 3: January 10, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

Added reset functionality and a minimum significant digit solver to my Stock Solution Calculator.

**Thoughts**: 

I am almost done this small project. I'm just wrapping it up with a neat way of dealing with answer formatting. I gotta find out how to make a standalone binary file out of this.

### Day 4: January 11, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

Added significant digit rounding capability to my Stock Solution Calculator.

**Thoughts**: 

Whew, rounding to an arbitrary number of significant digits was difficult than I initially anticipated. Aside from the lack of an executable and the bug with the number being changed (adding .0 in the String), this is almost a done deal.
I was asked to create a script for handling growth curve data in the lab so I'm hoping to brush up and learn a lot about R this weekend.
