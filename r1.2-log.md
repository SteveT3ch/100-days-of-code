# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 8, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

Played around with Java swing.

**Thoughts**:

I reset my challenge counter after missing about a week. The most important thing about this is being honest with myself and learning every day, not finishing the challenge itself.
My progress was waning the longer I did it, so I think I needed a reset and get back into gear.
I had to refresh my memory with what I learned last week. Tomorrow, I will work on some recursive problems.

### Day 2: November 9, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished Chapter 15 in the Java textbook.

**Thoughts**:

Learned about recursion and Fibonacci sequence. Solving problems recursively makes for very concise code, but it is a little tough to grasp.
Compared to grinding through GUI, it feels much more rewarding to get the "click" of figuring out an answer to a recursive problem.
Only one more chapter to go until I'm done my first CS textbook!
I still have some more recursive question to solve before I'm truly finished with this chapter though.

### Day 3: November 10, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Read a part of Chapter 16 in the Java textbook.

**Thoughts**:

I got introduced to Java Database Management Systems and SQL.
It's a lot to take in so I couldn't finish the whole section.
The fact that most of our technology is essentially dependent on these massive spreadsheets is fascinating.

### Day 4: November 11, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished all of Chapter 15 coding challenges in the Java textbook.

**Thoughts**:

Recursion finally clicked for me!
Doing all of the exercises really helped.
Looking forward to finishing the book with Databases tomorrow.

### Day 5: November 12, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Did a tutorial and pre-reading for R data analysis.

**Thoughts**:

Did some prepping for an R workshop tomorrow. Used a Youtube video tutorial to get familiar with the syntax of R and other basic analysis.
Got to play with a Titanic data set from kaggle.com. Data Science is extremely fascinating.

### Day 6: November 13, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Attended an R workshop.
Did Codewars coding challenges.

**Thoughts**:

I went to an R workshop hosted by my university today. Ironically, the 1 hour tutorial I watched on youtube was much more informative than the 3 hours of the workshop combined.
It was ultimately a waste of time but it gave me more exposure to R and the potential of data science.
After the workshop, I was all tutorial'd out and I got an itching to solve some problems. So I tackled some of the weekly challenges emailed to me by CodeWars.

### Day 7: November 14, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Read Chapter 16 of the Java textbook.

**Thoughts**:

Continued to learn more about SQL. It covers how to use it, but I don't really understand how SQL works in general and how to get the database up and running, so I will need to learn it from an online tutorial.

### Day 8: November 15, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

Started a beginner SQL course on Youtube.

**Thoughts**:

Databases are such a crucial component of modern programming but I still didn't get it after the Java book.
I started watching a 4.5 hour course video by Giraffe Academy on Youtube to get a strong foundation on SQL and relational databases.
My goal by the end of the year is to make a simple CRUD app.

### Skipped November 16, 2018 - Friday (1)

### Day 9: November 17, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Continued with the beginner SQL course on Youtube.

**Thoughts**:

Learned how to install MySQL and DBeaver SQL Editor.
Learned basic SQL commands and created a table for educational purposes.
I'm interested in how a database in a standalone app operates and still work without the user installing MySQL.

### Day 10: November 18, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 

Continued with the beginner SQL course on Youtube.

**Thoughts**:

Learned how to insert, delete, and update database entries. I will learn how to retrieve information and hopefully finish the tutorial to get started with an app tomorrow.

### Day 11: November 19, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished the SQL tutorial.
Finished the Maven tutorial.
Started drafting a Java project.

**Thoughts**:

Whew, I made up for my lack of progress these couple of weeks. I finished learning about SQL and MySQL and I also learned how to build Java classes into a JAR using Maven.
I need to learn Gradle in the future to learn Android development. For the time being, I'm going to put the things I learned and develop a Java desktop app that helps build Dungeons and Dragons characters.
I'm currently planning how to develop it, but it will communicate with an embedded DB (SQLite) in a minimalistic GUI to make it very easy to create characters on the go. If I knew Gradle, I could have made this on Android.
I plan to make it primarily for Homebrew (to avoid copyright claims) and privately distribute .csv files that can be used to import into the program.

### Day 12: November 21, 2018 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Drafted out GUI of my DnD 5e content viewer.

**Thoughts**:

I finished planning out what I am aiming to build. I drew a wireframe for my GUI and I am ready to begin!
However, I have severely underestimated the complexity of a seemingly simple info viewer.
There are two things I am still trying to learn: being able to pre-store data in the embedded DB right out the gate and how to change Java Swing panels by making a selection in another panel.

### Day 13: November 24, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Learning and troubleshooting SQLite.

**Thoughts**:

I spent an hour trying to get JDBC to connect with SQLite before being frustrated. This is a lot different and tougher than I initially imagined.
Perhaps a simpler project would have been better for learning. I still barely understand embedded databases after going through a couple of tutorials.
I will have to try doing a simple project to get my Java "feel" back and gain a bit of confidence from building a Java app. This may have been too ambitious for a first.

### Day 14: November 27, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

Reading up on REST APIs.

**Thoughts**:

A guide on the internet suggested that a good place to start after Java fundamentals is REST APIs using Spring Boot. So I have started getting familiarized with the concept of a REST API and building one in Java.
I am also learning to use Java IDEs as I have only been using VS Code.
