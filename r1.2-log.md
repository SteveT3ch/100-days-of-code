# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 8, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

Played around with Java swing.

**Thoughts**:

I reset my challenge counter after missing about a week. The most important thing about this is being honest with myself and learning every day, not finishing the challenge itself.
My progress was waning the longer I did it, so I think I needed a reset and get back into gear.
I had to refresh my memory with what I learned last week. Tomorrow, I will work on some recursive problems.
