# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 8, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

Played around with Java swing.

**Thoughts**:

I reset my challenge counter after missing about a week. The most important thing about this is being honest with myself and learning every day, not finishing the challenge itself.
My progress was waning the longer I did it, so I think I needed a reset and get back into gear.
I had to refresh my memory with what I learned last week. Tomorrow, I will work on some recursive problems.

### Day 2: November 9, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished Chapter 15 in the Java textbook.

**Thoughts**:

Learned about recursion and Fibonacci sequence. Solving problems recursively makes for very concise code, but it is a little tough to grasp.
Compared to grinding through GUI, it feels much more rewarding to get the "click" of figuring out an answer to a recursive problem.
Only one more chapter to go until I'm done my first CS textbook!
I still have some more recursive question to solve before I'm truly finished with this chapter though.

### Day 3: November 10, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

Read a part of Chapter 16 in the Java textbook.

**Thoughts**:

I got introduced to Java Database Management Systems and SQL.
It's a lot to take in so I couldn't finish the whole section.
The fact that most of our technology is essentially dependent on these massive spreadsheets is fascinating.

### Day 4: November 11, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished all of Chapter 15 coding challenges in the Java textbook.

**Thoughts**:

Recursion finally clicked for me!
Doing all of the exercises really helped.
Looking forward to finishing the book with Databases tomorrow.
